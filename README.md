# ![Image](https://www.knime.com/files/knime_logo_github_40x40_4layers.png) KNIME UI Extension Service for KNIMEÂ® Analytics Platform

This folder contains the frontend wrapper that implements adapter pattern between data providers (back-end services) and
data consumers (e.g. KNIME Views).

## Development

### Prerequisites

* Install [Node.js][node], see version in [.nvmrc](.nvmrc).

Newer versions may also work, but have not been tested.

Pull the contained [git submodules](https://stackoverflow.com/a/4438292/5134084) with
```sh
git submodule update --init
```

### Install dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

### Launch development server
To start project in a browser window for dev purposes use:
```sh
npm run dev
```

### Testing

#### Running unit tests
This project contains unit tests written with [jest]. They are run with

```sh
npm run test:unit
```

### Linting

```sh
npm run lint
```

### Git hooks

When running `npm install`, some git hooks (see [.husky/](.husky/)) will automatically be installed using [husky].
Please read the [docs in case you want to bypass or disable them](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/?id=bypass-hooks).

### Security audit

In some cases npm security issues can not be addressed right away or do not pose a direct threat (e.g. build
dependencies of nuxt). To deal with these run

```sh
npm run audit:resolve
```

The tool will present you with a few choices regarding every security issue, which you can choose from. Most of the
time it is sufficient to ignore issues for a certain amount of time (e.g. press `i` to ignore and then `M` for one
month). This will create a `audit-resolve.json` with the security exceptions that needs to be checked in.

To test if there is going to be security audit problems on our build system, call

```sh
npm run audit
```

which takes the exceptions into account.

## Build production version
Bundles with rollup into commonjs module
```sh
npm run build
```

## Basic usage in UI components
1. Add a submodule in app, where you wish to have access to KNIME service. To do so, run the command below in the root folder of the app where you want to use KNIME service.
```javascript
git submodule add https://bitbucket.org/KNIME/knime-ui-extension-service knime-ui-extension-service
```
1. Run `npm i` to install all dependencies.

2. To use the services inside a Vue-based KNIME UI component you have to import and instantiate each desired service with the
passed `knimeService` instance, e.g.
```javascript
...
import { JsonDataService } from 'knime-ui-extension-service';
...
props: {
    knimeService: {
        type: Object,
        required: true,
        default: null
    }
},
async mounted() {
    const jsonDataService = new JsonDataService(this.knimeService);
    this.initialData = await jsonDataService.getInitialData();
}
```
