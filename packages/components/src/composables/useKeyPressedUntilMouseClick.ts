 * Composable that returns whether user has navigated using the keyboard (pressed a key). Most useful as an *additional*
 * check to make focus styles visible when the document is navigated using key presses. Similar to `:focus-visible`
 * but with much more control over which keys are considered and can also be used in JS/TS code.
 * Keys can be defined with the `keys` parameter.
 *
 * Keyboard used state is reset when the document is clicked (`mousedown`).
