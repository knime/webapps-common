# ![Image](https://www.knime.com/files/knime_logo_github_40x40_4layers.png) KNIME JSONForms integration

# TODO: this is a copy from core-ui, needs to be adjusted yet ðŸš¨ðŸš¨

This repository contains the frontend components of the KNIME JSONForms integration that is based on [Vue].
It are built as a [Vue library] and used in KNIME Analytics Platform and/or KNIME Hub.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Install [Node.js][node], see version in [package.json](package.json).

Newer versions may also work, but have not been tested.

### Install dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

and then use the following commands. For detailed explanations see [Vue CLI docs]:

### Git hooks

When committing your changes, a couple of commit hooks will run via [husky].

- `pre-commit` hook to lint and format the changes in your stage zone (via [lintstaged])
- `prepare-commit-msg` hook to format your commit message to conform with the required format by KNIME. In order for this to work you must set environment variables with your Atlassian email and API token. Refer to `@knime/eslint-config/scripts/README.md` for more information.

### Testing

#### Running unit tests

This project contains unit tests written with [vitest]. They are run with

```sh
npm run test
```

or one can run unit- and integration-tests individually by

```sh
npm run test:unit
npm run test:integration
```

You can generate a coverage report with

```sh
npm run coverage
```

The output can be found in the `coverage` folder. It contains a browseable html report as well as raw coverage data in
[LCOV] and [Clover] format, which can be used in analysis software (SonarQube, Jenkins, â€¦).

### Running security audit

npm provides a check against known security issues of used dependencies. Run it by calling

```sh
npm run audit
```

### Logging

You can log using the global `consola` variable (which the embedding application needs to provide).

See https://github.com/nuxt/consola for details.

## Building

To build all views and dialogs, use the following command:

```sh
npm run build
```

To build a single item, use e.g. the following command:

```sh
npm run build:TableView
```

Results are saved to `/dist`.

This project can also be built via a maven build wrapper

```sh
mvn clean install
```

## Embedding the views in apps

The views can be used in Vue/Nuxt apps like a regular Vue component, e.g. loaded asynchronously.

### Requirements

The views expect that the embedding app provides the following:

- Vue and Consola compatible to the versions defined in [`package.json`](package.json)
- global `window.consola` instance for logging
- CSS variables as defined in the `@knime/styles` project.
  They are not included in the build in order to avoid duplication.

### Usage example

```
<TableView>
```
